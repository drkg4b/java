/**
 * If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach
 * to use. But in most of the scenarios, Singleton classes are created for
 * resources such as File System, Database connections etc and we should avoid
 * the instantiation until unlessclient calls the getInstancemethod. Also this
 * method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
